This is a web-app that allows users to input two US zip codes and returns the straight-line distance between them. Zip code data was obtained from http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/ and used to create a database using PostgresQL and Sequelize. Distance calculations use the haversine formula for calculating spherical distances (https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
